### Use the principle component analysis (PCA) to do the affine registration of Before image (orininal1.jpg) and after image (original2.jpg). 

The before image is :

The after image is: 

![after](https://github.com/niufuren/image-registration-using-PCA/blob/master/original2.jpg)

In the registerred image, boundary of the before image is marked in red colour, and the after image is marked in green colour:
